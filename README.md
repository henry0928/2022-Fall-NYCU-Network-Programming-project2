# 2022-Fall-NYCU-Network-Programming-project2

In this project, you are asked to design 3 kinds of servers:
1. Design a Concurrent connection-oriented server. This server allows one client connect to it.
2. Design a server of the chat-like systems, called remote working systems (rwg). In this system, users can communicate with
other users. You need to use the single-process concurrent paradigm to design this server.
3. Design the rwg server using the concurrent connection-oriented paradigm with shared memory and FIFO.
These three servers must support all functions in project 1.
